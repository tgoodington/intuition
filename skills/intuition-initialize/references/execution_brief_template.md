## Plan Title

**[One-line summary of what will be implemented]**

---

## Plan Summary

**Overview:** [2-3 sentence summary of what the plan accomplishes]

**Scope:** [What's included and excluded from this plan]

**Key changes:**
- Change 1
- Change 2
- Change 3

---

## Objective

**What will be different after execution:** [Concrete outcome]

**Measurable impact:** [How success is measured]

---

## Discovery Context

**Problem solved:** [Reference the original problem from discovery]

**User value:** [What users gain]

**Technical rationale:** [Why this approach was chosen]

---

## Design Specifications

[List all design specs produced during the design phase, if any:]
- `design_spec_[item1].md` — [One-line summary]
- `design_spec_[item2].md` — [One-line summary]

**IMPORTANT:** Execute agents MUST read these specs before implementing flagged tasks. Implement exactly what's specified. If ambiguity is found, escalate to user — do not make design decisions autonomously.

[If no design phase was run, omit this section.]
