# Plan: [Title]

> Generated by Magellan (intuition-plan) on [DATE]
> Based on Discovery Brief from [DISCOVERY_DATE]
> Workflow Status: Ready for Execution

---

## Objective

[Clear statement of what will be accomplished - derived from discovery goals]

---

## Discovery Summary

**Problem:** [From discovery_brief.md]

**Goals:** [From discovery_brief.md]

**Users:** [From discovery_brief.md]

**Motivations:** [From discovery_brief.md]

**Scope Boundaries:** [From discovery_brief.md]

---

## Research Context

**Codebase Analysis:**
[Findings from Research agent - architecture, patterns, relevant files]

**Existing Patterns:**
[Patterns to follow or build upon]

**Technical Constraints:**
[Discovered limitations or requirements]

**Security Considerations:**
[Findings from Security Expert agent]

---

## Assumptions

| Assumption | Source | Confidence | Notes |
|------------|--------|------------|-------|
| [From discovery] | Discovery | High/Medium/Low | [Context] |
| [From research] | Research | High/Medium/Low | [Context] |
| [From planning] | Planning | High/Medium/Low | [Context] |

---

## Approach

**Strategy:**
[High-level approach and rationale]

**Why This Approach:**
[Connection to discovery goals and constraints]

**Alternatives Considered:**
[Other approaches and why they weren't chosen]

---

## Tasks

### Task 1: [Title]
- **Description:** [What needs to be done]
- **Confidence:** High/Medium/Low
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] [Criterion 1]
  - [ ] [Criterion 2]
- **Dependencies:** None / [Task X]
- **Assigned To:** [Code Writer / Test Runner / etc.]
- **Estimated Complexity:** Low/Medium/High

### Task 2: [Title]
- **Description:** [What needs to be done]
- **Confidence:** High/Medium/Low
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] [Criterion 1]
  - [ ] [Criterion 2]
- **Dependencies:** Task 1
- **Assigned To:** [Code Writer / Test Runner / etc.]
- **Estimated Complexity:** Low/Medium/High

[Continue for all tasks...]

---

## Dependencies

```
Task 1 (no dependencies)
  ↓
Task 2 (depends on Task 1)
  ↓
Task 3 & Task 4 (parallel, depend on Task 2)
  ↓
Task 5 (depends on Task 3 & Task 4)
```

**Parallel Opportunities:**
[Tasks that can be executed simultaneously]

**Critical Path:**
[Tasks that block others and determine overall timeline]

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | High/Medium/Low | High/Medium/Low | [Strategy] |
| [Risk 2] | High/Medium/Low | High/Medium/Low | [Strategy] |

---

## Quality Gates

**Before Marking Complete:**
- [ ] All tasks completed successfully
- [ ] Security Expert reviewed (MANDATORY)
- [ ] All acceptance criteria verified
- [ ] Code Reviewer approved (if code written)
- [ ] Tests pass (if applicable)

---

## Self-Reflection Notes

**Planning Confidence:** High/Medium/Low

**Key Decisions Made:**
[Important choices during planning and rationale]

**Areas of Uncertainty:**
[Where Faraday should be cautious or seek clarification]

**Refinements During Planning:**
[How the plan evolved and why]

---

## Execution Notes for Faraday

**Recommended Execution Order:**
[Suggested sequence based on dependencies and risk]

**Parallelization Opportunities:**
[Where Faraday can speed up with parallel execution]

**Watch Points:**
[Areas requiring extra attention during execution]

**Fallback Strategies:**
[What to do if specific tasks fail]
