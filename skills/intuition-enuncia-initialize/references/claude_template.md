## Project Workflow and Memory System

This project uses the Enuncia pipeline (`@tgoodington/intuition`). Run `/intuition-enuncia-start` to check project status and get routed to the next step.

### Memory Files

Project memory is maintained in `docs/project_notes/` for consistency across sessions:

- **bugs.md** — Bug log with dates, solutions, and prevention notes
- **decisions.md** — Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) with context and trade-offs
- **key_facts.md** — Project configuration, credentials, ports, important URLs
- **issues.md** — Work log with ticket IDs, descriptions, and URLs
- **project_map.md** — Living architecture document, updated as the project evolves

### Memory-Aware Protocols

**Before proposing architectural changes:**
- Check `docs/project_notes/decisions.md` for existing decisions
- Verify the proposed approach doesn't conflict with past choices
- If it does conflict, acknowledge the existing decision and explain why a change is warranted

**When encountering errors or bugs:**
- Search `docs/project_notes/bugs.md` for similar issues
- Apply known solutions if found
- Document new bugs and solutions when resolved

**When looking up project configuration:**
- Check `docs/project_notes/key_facts.md` for credentials, ports, URLs, service accounts
- Prefer documented facts over assumptions

**When completing work on tickets:**
- Log completed work in `docs/project_notes/issues.md`
- Include ticket ID, date, brief description, and URL
